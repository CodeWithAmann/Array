1Ans:-
 An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is accessed by its index.

2Ans:- To create an array in Java, you specify the type of elements the array will hold, followed by square brackets [], and then the name of the array variable. For example:

int[] myArray; // This declares an array of integers

3Ans:- In Java, once an array is created, its size cannot be changed at runtime. You need to create a new array with the desired size and copy the elements if you want to resize the array.

4Ans:- No, in Java, you cannot declare an array without assigning its size. You need to specify the size of the array at the time of declaration.

5Ans:- The default value of an array element in Java depends on its type. For primitive data types (like int, float, double, etc.), the default value is 0. For object types (like String, Object, etc.), the default value is null.

6Ans:- A 1D array is an array that stores elements in a single row or single column. For example:
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // 1D array of integers


7Ans:- Here's a simple program to demonstrate a 2D array in Java:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize a 2D array
        int[][] matrix = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} };

        // Access and print elements of the 2D array
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after each row
        }
    }
}
This program creates and prints a 2D array representing a matrix.
